This package of Matlab codes are developed for implementing the developments in the following paper. Feel free to contact me at pengfeiwei@nwpu.edu.cn if you have any question.

Wei, P., Zheng, Y., Fu, J., Xu, Y., & Gao, W. (2023). An expected integrated error reduction function for accelerating Bayesian active learning of failure probability. Reliability Engineering & System Safety, 231, 108971.

Run the file "testU_EIER.m", it will first implement the Bayesian active learning based on U function, and then with EIER function, utimately to produce the results generated by these two methods. It produce results like what follows, and a figure for comparing the training details produced by the two acquisition functions.

Mean estimate of pf with U function： 0.0903
Upper Credible bound of Pf using U function： 0.09100
Lower Credible bound of Pf using U function： 0.08970
Ncall by U function： 47
Mean estimate of pf with EIER function： 0.0916
Upper Credible bound of Pf using EIER function： 0.09590
Lower Credible bound of Pf using EIER function： 0.08820
Ncall by EIER function： 30
