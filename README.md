This package of Matlab codes are developed for implementing the developments in the following paper. Feel free to contact me at pengfeiwei@nwpu.edu.cn if you have any question.

Wei, P., Zheng, Y., Fu, J., Xu, Y., & Gao, W. (2023). An expected integrated error reduction function for accelerating Bayesian active learning of failure probability. Reliability Engineering & System Safety, 231, 108971.

You can implement the file "testU_EIER.m", and it first implement the Bayesian active learning based on U function, and then with EIER function, utimately to produce the results generated by these two methods. It produce results like what follows, and a figure for comparing the training details produced by the two acquisition functions.




Note: The codes is partly developed based on the "randomfield" following the Copyright 2011 Qiqi Wang (qiqi@mit.edu) and Paul G. Constantine (paul.constantine@stanford.edu).
